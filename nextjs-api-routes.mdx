Complete the following steps to start capturing errors from your API routes.

<Steps>

<Step title="Initialize Decipher on the backend">

Create a `decipher.config.[ts|js]` at your project root (sibling to app/ or pages/ directory).

```typescript src/decipher.config.ts
import { Decipher } from "@decipher-sdk/nextjs";

Decipher.init({
  codebaseId: "CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE",
  customerId: "MY_CUSTOMER_ID", // Find in /settings
});

export default Decipher;
```

</Step>
<Step title="Update your API routes">

Choose instructions based on your app structure:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="App Router" defaultOpen={true}>

    The steps below apply if you're using [Next.js App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

    Import `Decipher` into your route files and wrap your handlers using `Decipher.withDecipher` as below.
    ```typescript src/app/api/example/route.ts

import type { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server";
import Decipher from "@/decipher.config";

async function handler(req: NextRequest) {
const body = await req.json();
return NextResponse.json({ message: 'Processed successfully' },
{ status: 200 });
}

export const POST = Decipher.withDecipher(handler);
```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Pages Router">
        The steps below apply if you're using [Next.js Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages).

    Import `Decipher` into your route files and wrap your handlers using `Decipher.withDecipherPage` as below.
    ```typescript src/pages/api/example/route.ts

import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import Decipher from "@/decipher.config";

const handler = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => {
res.status(200).json({ name: "Jane Smith" });
};

export default Decipher.withDecipherPage(handler);
```
  </Accordion>

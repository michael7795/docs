## Report caught errors to Decipher

<Steps>
<Step title="Initialize Decipher on the backend">

You should have already installed the Decipher NextJS SDK when you [integrated Decipher](/next.js.integrate). This is required to continue.

Create a `decipher.config.[ts|js]` at your project root (sibling to app/ or pages/ directory).

```typescript src/decipher.config.ts
import { Decipher } from "@decipher-sdk/nextjs";

Decipher.init({
  codebaseId: "CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE",
  customerId: "MY_CUSTOMER_ID", // Find in /settings
});

export default Decipher;
```

</Step>
<Step title="Report backend errors">
To capture error's with handled exceptions (e.g. in a `try`/`catch` block), use `Decipher.captureError(error)`:

```typescript route.ts
import type { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next";
import Decipher from "@/decipher.config";

async function handler(req: NextRequest) {
  // ...
  try {
    thisFunctionMightThrowErrors();
  } catch (error) {
    Decipher.captureError(error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { message: "An error occurred." },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
  // ...
  return NextResponse.json(
    { message: "Processed successfully" },
    { status: 200 }
  );
}

export const POST = Decipher.withDecipher(handler);
```

</Step>
</Steps>
That's it! Decipher will now capture caught errors and automatically include helpful data associated with the request.

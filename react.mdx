## Step 1: Sign in to Decipher

Sign in to [Decipher](https://app.getdecipher.com) using **your work email address** and a `customerId` will be automatically created for you, which you'll use in the next step.

## Step 2: Integrate the SDK

### Install the SDK

```shell Terminal
npm install @decipher-sdk/frontend
```

### Initialize the `DecipherFrontend` object in your app.

Simply import `DecipherFrontend` and declare it anywhere in your app, ideally at the top-level.

```typescript app.tsx
import { DecipherFrontend } from "@decipher-sdk/frontend";

DecipherFrontend.init({
  customerId: "YOUR_CUSTOMER_ID_FROM_STEP_1",
  codebaseId: "YOUR_FRONTEND_CODEBASE_NAME", // You choose this to group errors in Decipher.
});

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: Readonly<{
  children: React.ReactNode;
}>) {
  return (
   // ...
  );
}
```

That's it! Decipher will now automatically capture sessions with errors, alongside useful runtime data for debugging, and surface them on the [Dashboard](https://app.getdecipher.com/).
These sessions will be analyzed for user impact analysis and priority.

## For apps using tRPC, add the tRPC Middleware.

Import `decipherTrpcMiddleware` and add it to the relevant procedure as below.

```typescript src/server/api/trpc.ts
// ...
import { decipherTrpcMiddleware } from "@decipher-sdk/nextjs";

// ...
export const publicProcedure = t.procedure.use(
  decipherTrpcMiddleware({
    // A codebase name of your choice to identify errors in Decipher.
    codebaseId: "CODEBASE_NAME_OF_MY_CHOICE",
    customerId: "MY_CUSTOMER_ID_FROM_STEP_1",
  })
);
```

That's it! Decipher will now monitor and surface all your errors and exceptions on [the dashboard](https://www.prod.getdecipher.com).
